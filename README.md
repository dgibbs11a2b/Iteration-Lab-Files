Here is a description of each Python program, its respective file name, and its intended purpose.
1.	Hello World 100x.py – This program was designed to print the greeting, “Hello World” 100 times to the screen.

2.	Loop numbers and square.py – This program will print the numbers 12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, and 20 to the screen; each on a new line. Then, it will calculate the square root of each numbers and display the results of the screen.

3.	Polygon.py – This program will prompt the user for the number of sides, the length of each side, a line color, and a fill color in order to create a polygon. The program will draw the polygon and fill the shape with the user’s specified color. You can then click on the window when the drawing is complete, and the window will close.

4.	Divisible Numbers.py – This program creates an iteration for integers between 1 and 50, in numeric order. Each number that is divisible by three will only have a description indicating that it is indeed a multiple of three and instead of the number printing, it will print, “Divisible by three”. Each number that is divisible by five will only have a description indicating that it is indeed a multiple of five and instead of the number printing, it will print, “Divisible by five”. If the number to be printed is divisible by three and five, then the program will print, “Divisible by both”. Otherwise, if the number to be printed is not divisible by three or five, the program will just display the number. 

5.	Turtle Picture.py – Using the Turtle Graphics module, I’ve created a Turtle names Bradly. I’ve instructed the program to create a background color of blue, set a title, and created a turtle named, Bradley. Bradley has been instructed to take a white pen, set its size to “2”, and then create a five-pointed star. Finally, after the picture is drawn, you will have the ability to close the screen by clicking on it.
